        My entire life I have always had a great passion for technology and
        problem solving and I wanted to pursue a career which reflects that.{" "}

      <p className="p2">
        Earlier this year I did just that, I completed a 16 week hands-on
        Professional Software Development Course with CodeClan. I learned
        invaluable skills both technical and core. From software languages and
        testing, all the way down to industry practices.

        Outside of work, I am a music fanatic and in my free time you’ll rarely
        find me without it, I’m also an avid football fan and player, playing 3
        or 4 times a week.
